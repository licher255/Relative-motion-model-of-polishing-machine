# Relative Motion Model of A Polishing Machine
In this work, a motion model is developed for a special polishing machine structure. 

All samples are loaded with pressure and polished by rotation in the machine. Since the machine can only set the rotation speed of the fixture and the rotation speed of the polishing surface separately, the relative speed of the sample with respect to the polishing surface is of particular interest. 

In this project, this relative speed and the motion trajectory of the sample will be derived and displayed through pictures and motion animations.
