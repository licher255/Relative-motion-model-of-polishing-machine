# Kinematic Models Relative to Rotational Motion
## 1. Gemetry model of polishing mashine
So far, in order to adapt to the polishing of different objects, various types of polishing machines have been developed, and they have different mechanical structures and kinematic models. In this project, the model we built is about a polishing machine in which the polishing plane and the fixture rotate independently. Its abstract model is as follows:

The circle O represents the plane equipped with the polishing cloth, and the circle H represents the fixture loaded with 8 circular specimens. And circle W represents the specimens.

As shown in the figure 1, while the circle H rotates around the point O, it also rotates around the point H.

## 2. Mathematical calculation process

Figure 2.1 shows the relationship between motion in time $t$. The counterclockwise direction is defined as the positive direction in calculation. If the disk rotates clockwise by the angle $\alpha$ in the world coordinate system, this is equivalent to the workpiece holder rotating counterclockwise by the angle $\alpha$ in the disk coordinate system O-x-y. At this time, the angle of rotation of any point $W$ on the work holder is $\alpha$ plus the angle of rotation of the work holder. The angle from point $W$ to point $W {'}$ is recorded as $\beta$.

If the workpiece also rotates, in the O-x-y coordinate system the angle rotated around a specific point on the workpiece is $\delta$.

Then the following relationship arises:

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha =& \omega_{ss}t + \alpha_0 \\
\beta =& \omega_{ss}t + \omega_{hs}t + \beta_0\notag\\
\delta =& \omega_{ss}t +\omega_{hs}t + \omega_{ws}t + \delta_0\notag
\end{align}
$$

In the absolute coordinate system O-x-y, the work holder and the wheel perform independent rotational motions. If the lapping wheel speed is recorded as $n_s$, the work holder speed is recorded as $n_h$. Assuming that their units are the $rad /s$, there is:

$$\omega_s = \frac{\pi n_s }{30}$$
$$\omega_h = \frac{\pi n_h }{30}$$
where:
- $\omega_s$ is the rotational speed of the lapping wheel. (with unit mm/s)
- $\omega_h$ is the rotational speed of the work holder. (with unit mm/s)

this allows the vector of movement from the center of the workpiece to be calculated:

$$
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{r_{ow}}= a_{oh}
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\alpha\\
sin\alpha
\end{bmatrix} + a_{hw} \begin{bmatrix}
cos \beta \\ sin \beta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$
The relative speed $\overrightarrow{r_{ow}}$ is determined by vector differentiation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{v_{ow,s}}=\dot{\overrightarrow{r_{ow}}}= a_{oh}\omega_{ss}
\begin{bmatrix}
-sin\alpha\\
cos\alpha
\end{bmatrix} + a_{hw}(\omega_{ss} +\omega_{hs})\begin{bmatrix}
-sin \beta \\ cos \beta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

If self-expansion of workpieces in workpiece holders would be taken into account, the points on the edge of the workpieces must also be considered. The speed of this is described as follows:
$$
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{v_{op,s}}=\dot{\overrightarrow{r_{op}}}= a_{oh}\omega_{ss}
\begin{bmatrix}
-sin\alpha\\
cos\alpha
\end{bmatrix}
+ a_{hw} (\omega_{ss}+\omega_{hs})
\begin{bmatrix}
-sin \beta \\ cos \beta
\end{bmatrix}
+ a_{wp}(\omega_{ss}+\omega_{hs}+\omega_{ws})
\begin{bmatrix}
-sin \delta \\ cos \delta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

During the actual test, the sample rotated in the workpiece holder, but in this study, the rotation of the sample was ignored for the following two reasons: 1. The rotation could not be detected and measured in this experiment. 2. Due to the pressure with the head, there is almost no rotation. That is, $\omega_{ws} = 0 rpm$.

## 3. Discussion of the model
In this test, the motion conditions of the polishing process were as follows:

The workpiece holder circle and the disk circle were inscribed at point P.

The rotation speed of the workpiece holder was fixed at 30 rpm in all tests, and the disk circles were changed only for the relative speed study.
